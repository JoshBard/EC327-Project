Project General Description:
        Our aim is to bridge the gap between the creative distribution of social media and the commerce and scheduling tools of software like Square. Many tattoo artists, body modification artists, hair stylists, and other artists advertise on software that is different than where they book appointments. For example, you may come across a tattoo that you like on Instagram. If you are looking to get a tattoo from that artist, it will require going to their profile, then a website linked to their profile, then booking the appointment on a site that has not been globalized. Our goal is to offer artists one app where they can advertise and book in one step, hopefully adding to the rate of people who book appointments. For consumers, we offer a feed based on what friends are viewing and booking as well as artists located nearby. To increase the quality of service we will include a rating system as well as a place for customers to post photos of the work. This app will also create a market for artists who are not able to reach people who do not have typical social media but who are interested in body modification.
